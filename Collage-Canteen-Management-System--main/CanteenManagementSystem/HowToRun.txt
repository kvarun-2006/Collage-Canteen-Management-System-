To run the Canteen Management System, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Java JDK 11+ installed.
- MySQL Server installed and running.
- Apache Tomcat 9 downloaded and extracted (already done in `tomcat/`).

### 1. Set Up the Database
- Start MySQL service.
- Create database: `CREATE DATABASE canteen_db;`
- Run the setup script: `mysql -u root -p canteen_db < setup.sql`
- Update `src/main/java/com/canteen/utils/DatabaseConnection.java` with your MySQL URL, USER, PASSWORD.

### 2. Deploy and Start the Application
- The WAR file is already copied to `tomcat/apache-tomcat-9.0.96/webapps/CanteenManagementSystem-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war`.
- Start Tomcat: Navigate to `tomcat/apache-tomcat-9.0.96/bin/` and run `startup.bat` (on Windows).
- Wait for Tomcat to deploy the WAR (check logs in `tomcat/apache-tomcat-9.0.96/logs/catalina.out`).

### 3. Access the Application
- Open a web browser.
- **Customer Menu**: Go to `http://localhost:8080/CanteenManagementSystem-1.0-SNAPSHOT/index.html`
  - View menu items, add to cart, calculate total, place order, view bill.
- **Admin Login**: Go to `http://localhost:8080/CanteenManagementSystem-1.0-SNAPSHOT/admin-login.html`
  - Login with username `admin`, password `admin123`.
  - Access dashboard for menu management, order viewing, and reports.

### 4. Test the Workflow
- As a customer: Browse menu, add items to cart, checkout, see bill.
- As admin: Login, manage menu (add/edit/delete items), view orders, generate sales reports.

The application uses AJAX for dynamic updates, localStorage for cart persistence, and prepared statements for database security. If issues occur, check Tomcat logs or ensure MySQL is running.
